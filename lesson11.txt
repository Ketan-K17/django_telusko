1. It's all about having a bunch of static files in a 'static' folder, complete with all js, css, and html.

2. the settings.py file of the project is then changed to make the project aware of these files

3. after this, you're supposed to run 
python manage.py collectstatic, to 'collect' the static files, into a new folder on the app level (say 'assets').

note that this is all happening at the app level (i.e. under the project's base directory.)

4. once this is done, you need to copy the html files you'll actually display, from the static folder to the templates folder, and tweak every single html file to use the css, js that was given in the static folder.

you do this through that 'load static' code (it's slightly tedious since you need to do this for every href/src tag present in the html file.)

5. once this is done, you can just run the project through

python manage.py runserver.




## about the collectstatic command

The `python manage.py collectstatic` command is an important Django management command that serves a crucial purpose in production deployments. Here's what it does:

1. **Purpose:**
   - In production, Django doesn't serve static files directly (for performance and security reasons)
   - Instead, these files should be served by your web server (like Nginx, Apache) or a CDN
   - `collectstatic` gathers all static files from all your apps and third-party packages into a single directory that can be served by your web server

2. **What it does:**
   - Looks through all your `STATICFILES_DIRS` and each app's static folder
   - Copies all the files it finds into the `STATIC_ROOT` directory (which you specify in settings.py)
   - Consolidates static files from:
     - Your project's static files
     - Each installed app's static files
     - Any third-party package static files

3. **Example structure:**
```
Before collectstatic:
myproject/
    app1/
        static/
            app1/
                css/
                js/
    app2/
        static/
            app2/
                images/
    static/
        css/
        js/
        images/

After collectstatic:
myproject/
    staticfiles/  # or whatever STATIC_ROOT is set to
        css/
        js/
        images/
        app1/
            css/
            js/
        app2/
            images/
```

4. **Settings involved:**
```python
# settings.py
STATIC_URL = '/static/'  # URL to use when referring to static files
STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']  # Additional locations of static files
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'  # Where collectstatic will collect files
```

5. **When to use:**
   - During development: You don't need it (Django's development server serves static files automatically)
   - In production: You must run it before deploying your application
   - After updating static files: Run it again to update the collected files

This command is essential for production deployments because:
- It organizes all static files in one place for efficient serving
- It helps with versioning and caching of static files
- It's a requirement for many hosting platforms (like Heroku)
- It's more secure than letting your application server handle static files
