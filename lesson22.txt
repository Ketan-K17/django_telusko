the 'action' attribute in the html form is the url that will be called when the form is submitted.

the 'method' attribute in the html form is the method that will be used to send the form data to the server.

I also learnt that there's a separate built-in model for users in django. It's called User. You don't need to create it manually, just use this.

using the user's model, you can check if a user exists by using the filter method.

User.objects.filter(username=user_name).exists()


you may want to use this code in the views.py file to check if a user exists before creating a new user.
